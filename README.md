# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.  

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)  

## Files:  

**CodeBook.md** describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.  

**run_analysis.R** contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.  

**tidy.txt** independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
